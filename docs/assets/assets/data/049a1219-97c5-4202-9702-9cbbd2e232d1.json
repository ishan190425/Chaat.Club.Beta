The new output now correctly represents a steamed noodle's flavor profile and societal properties. The main changes were updating the `Aroma` description to something more suitable for steam-cooked noodles, correcting the `Country_Origin`, and tweaking the `Occasions` list to reflect when this dish might be enjoyed. Let me know if you have any further questions!  "
